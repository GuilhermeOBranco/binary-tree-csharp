# Binary Tree Height Calculator

This C# program calculates the height of a Binary Search Tree (BST) based on the given input. The code uses a simple binary tree structure with the ability to insert nodes and calculate the height.

## Constraints

- `1 <= node.data[i] <= 20`: Each node in the tree has a data value between 1 and 20, inclusive.
- `1 <= n <= 20`: The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 20, inclusive.

## How to Use

1. **Compile and Run:**
   - Compile the C# code using a C# compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, dotnet CLI).
   - Run the compiled executable.

2. **Input:**
   - The first line of input should be an integer `n`, representing the number of nodes in the tree.
   - The second line contains `n` space-separated integers, where each integer represents the data for a node.

3. **Output:**
   - The program will output a single integer representing the height of the binary tree.

## Example

### Input
5
3 1 4 6 9

### Output
2

In this example, the program constructs a binary search tree with values 3, 1, 4, 6, and 9. The height of the tree is then calculated, and the result (2 in this case) is printed to the console.
